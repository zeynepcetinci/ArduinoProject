# ArduinoProject
ULTRASONIC SENSOR - GAS SENSOR - PIR MOTION SENSOR 

In this arduino project, there are 3 different arduino projects.
In my power point file, the videos of the projects and the materials used are written.

In the distance sensor project, if the distance is less than 2 cm, the LED is on.

To test my gas sensor project, I blew out the lit candle. And then I brought the gas sensor closer to the smoke. After detecting the smoke, the DC motor becomes active.

In my PIR sensor project, the buzzer and led are activated after motion is detected.
